## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alanube-python.git
   cd alanube-python
   ```

3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/wilmerm/alanube-python.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "from alanube.do import Alanube; print('Setup successful!')"
```

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 style guidelines and use several tools to maintain code quality.

### Code Formatting

We use `black` for code formatting:

```bash
# Format all Python files
black alanube/

# Check formatting without making changes
black --check alanube/
```

### Linting

We use `flake8` for linting:

```bash
# Run flake8
flake8 alanube/

# Run with specific configuration
flake8 alanube/ --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503
```

### Type Checking

We use `mypy` for type checking:

```bash
# Run type checking
mypy alanube/
```

### Import Sorting

We use `isort` for import sorting:

```bash
# Sort imports
isort alanube/

# Check import sorting
isort --check-only alanube/
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to automatically run these checks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts
pre-commit install

# Run against all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover -s alanube/tests -p "*.py"

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest alanube.tests.test_api

# Run specific test method
python -m unittest alanube.tests.test_api.TestAlanubeAPI.test_send_fiscal_invoice

# Run with verbose output
python -m unittest discover -s alanube/tests -p "*.py" -v
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
# Install coverage
pip install coverage

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run -m unittest discover -s alanube/tests -p "*.py"

# Generate coverage report
coverage report

# Generate HTML coverage report
coverage html
```

### Writing Tests

When writing tests, follow these guidelines:

1. **Test Structure**
   ```python
   import unittest
   from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
   from alanube.do import Alanube
   from alanube.do.exceptions import AlanubeException

   class TestAlanubeAPI(unittest.TestCase):
       def setUp(self):
           """Set up test fixtures."""
           self.api_token = "test_token"
           Alanube.connect(self.api_token, developer_mode=True)

       def tearDown(self):
           """Clean up after tests."""
           pass

       def test_send_fiscal_invoice_success(self):
           """Test successful fiscal invoice sending."""
           # Test implementation
           pass

       def test_send_fiscal_invoice_invalid_payload(self):
           """Test fiscal invoice with invalid payload."""
           # Test implementation
           pass
   ```

2. **Mocking External Dependencies**
   ```python
   @patch('alanube.do.api.requests.post')
   def test_api_call(self, mock_post):
       # Mock the response
       mock_response = MagicMock()
       mock_response.status_code = 200
       mock_response.json.return_value = {"id": "test_id"}
       mock_post.return_value = mock_response

       # Test the method
       result = Alanube.send_document(encf_type=31, payload={})

       # Assertions
       self.assertEqual(result["id"], "test_id")
       mock_post.assert_called_once()
   ```

3. **Test Naming**
   - Use descriptive test method names
   - Follow the pattern: `test_method_name_scenario`
   - Include docstrings explaining what the test does

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Test both success and failure scenarios
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Test error handling and exceptions
   - Aim for at least 80% code coverage

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

All public methods should have docstrings following Google style:

```python
def send_document(self, encf_type: int, payload: dict) -> dict:
    """Send an electronic document of the specified type.

    Args:
        encf_type (int): The type of the eNCF document.
        payload (dict): The data required to send the document.

    Returns:
        dict: The response from the Alanube API containing document information.

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If the payload is invalid.
        AuthenticationError: If authentication fails.
        AlanubeException: For other API errors.

    Example:
        >>> payload = {"company_id": "123", "customer": {...}}
        >>> response = Alanube.send_document(31, payload)
        >>> print(response["document_number"])
        'B0100000001'
    """
    pass
```

### Documentation Updates

1. **Update docstrings** for all modified methods
