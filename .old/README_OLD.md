# Old Version of Alanube API Client

## Overview

This directory contains the previous version of the Alanube API Client application. The codebase has been completely rewritten from scratch, and this directory serves as an archive for the old implementation.

## Contents

The files and directories in this `old` directory represent the state of the application before the recent rewrite. This includes:
- Old implementation files
- Legacy modules and utilities
- Previous API integration logic

## Purpose

The purpose of retaining this old version is to provide a reference point and to ensure that any specific legacy functionality or logic can still be reviewed if needed. It also serves as documentation of the application's evolution.

## Important Note

The code in this directory is no longer maintained or supported. Any new features, bug fixes, or updates will be applied to the new version of the application.

## New Version

The new version of the Alanube API Client has been built from the ground up with improved structure, functionality, and maintainability. For the latest features and updates, please refer to the root directory of the repository.

## Contact

If you have any questions about the old version or need assistance with transitioning to the new version, please contact the development team.
